# Yeelight TypeScript API Wrapper

This package provides a robust TypeScript library for controlling Yeelight smart devices over your local network. It simplifies the process of device discovery and command transmission, leveraging Node.js and TypeScript for a type-safe, event-driven architecture.

## Features

- **Device Discovery**: Automatically locate Yeelight devices on your local network using SSDP.
- **Control Commands**: Send commands to control power, brightness, color, and more.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for enhanced code reliability and maintainability.
- **Event-Driven**: Utilizes Node.js's EventEmitter for real-time device interaction.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for easy integration into any Node.js or TypeScript project.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install yeelight-typescript-wrapper
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to get started with the Yeelight TypeScript API Wrapper:

### Discovering Devices

```typescript
import Yeelight from 'yeelight-typescript-wrapper';

const light = new Yeelight();

light.on('listening', () => {
    light.discoverDevices();
});

light.on('deviceDiscovered', (deviceInfo) => {
    console.log('Discovered Device:', deviceInfo);
    // Example of turning on a light if the IP is known:
    const ip = deviceInfo.location.split('//')[1].split(':')[0];
    light.sendCommand(ip, 'set_power', ['on', 'smooth', 500], (response) => {
        console.log('Light turned on:', response);
    });
});
```

### Handling Errors

```typescript
light.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

## API Reference

- `discoverDevices()`: Broadcasts a search on the local network to find Yeelight devices.
- `sendCommand(ip: string, method: string, params: Array<string | number>, callback: (response: any) => void)`: Sends a command to a specific Yeelight device.
